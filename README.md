# 📱 Mobile Addiction Risk Detector

A machine learning-powered web application that analyzes your mobile usage patterns and predicts your addiction risk level. Built with Streamlit and scikit-learn.

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive 4-Step Quiz**: Answer questions about your phone usage habits
- **ML-Powered Predictions**: Uses Decision Tree classifier to assess addiction risk
- **Beautiful Dark UI**: Modern gradient design with glowing animations
- **Risk Categories**: Low, Medium, or High addiction risk
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Step-by-step questionnaire with progress tracking
- **Digital Wellness Tips**: Sidebar with helpful suggestions
- **Instant Results**: See your risk assessment immediately

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-addiction-risk-detector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Train the ML model** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   This creates `addiction_model.pkl` that the app uses.

2. **Start the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open in browser**:
   - Local: `http://localhost:8501`
   - Network: `http://192.168.1.4:8501`

## 📊 How It Works

### The Quiz
Answer 4 questions about your mobile habits:
1. **Phone Usage**: How often do you use your phone?
2. **Social Media**: How much time on social media?
3. **Sleep Hours**: How many hours do you sleep daily?
4. **Phone Pickups**: How often do you check your phone?

### The Prediction
The trained ML model analyzes your answers and predicts:
- 🟢 **Low Risk**: Balanced usage, healthy habits
- 🟡 **Medium Risk**: Some concern, consider reducing screen time
- 🔴 **High Risk**: Signs of addiction, digital detox recommended

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Quiz Questions
Edit the `options_1`, `options_2`, `options_3`, `options_4` lists in `app.py`

### Modify Risk Thresholds
Update the `screen_time_map`, `social_media_map`, `sleep_hours_map`, `pickups_map` dictionaries in `app.py`

### Retrain the Model
Edit the dataset in `train_model.py` and run:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Customize Colors
Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown()` section for different themes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 8501 is in use, Streamlit will use the next available port. Check the terminal output for the correct URL.

### Model Not Found
Ensure you've run `python train_model.py` first to generate `addiction_model.pkl`

### Dependencies Error
Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

### Permission Denied (macOS/Linux)
Use `python` instead of `python3`:
```bash
python train_model.py
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

## 📈 Model Accuracy

The model is trained on a sample dataset of 10 data points. For production use:
- Collect more training data
- Validate with real user data
- Adjust thresholds based on research
- Consider collecting feedback for model improvement
